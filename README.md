# laravel-authenticate

Extremely simple way to authenticate in Laravel.

## Usage

Install illuminate/html and add its service and provider.

	composer require nonoesp/thinker:dev

	php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Nonoesp\Authenticate\AuthenticateServiceProvider" --tag=middleware

Add this middleware to the routes you want to restrict to logged-user access.

Inside `app/Http/Kernel.php` add the following:

```php
protected $routeMiddleware = [
    [â€¦]
    'login' => \Arma\Http\Middleware\LoginMiddleware::class,
];
```

*Deprecated notes from Laravel 4 version.*

## Installation

Run `compose require nonoesp/authenticate:dev-master`

Add `'Nonoesp/Authenticate/AuthenticateServiceProvider',` to `providers` in `/app/config/app.php`

## Publish Package Assets while Developing in the Workbench

The following command will copy your assets into `/public/packages/vendor/package/`. Development should be continued on the workbench. Then you can run the command again if you want to update the previously published assets.

`php artisan asset:publish --bench="vendor/package"`
